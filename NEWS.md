# nominatimlite (development version)

-   Add a `progressbar` parameter to `geo_lite()`, `geo_lite_sf()`,
    `reverse_geo_lite()` and `reverse_geo_lite_sf()` to display progress in the
    console.

## Deprecated

-   `geo_amenity()` and `geo_amenity_sf()`, see
    [Nominatim/issues/1311](https://github.com/osm-search/Nominatim/issues/1311).
-   `nominatimlite::osm_amenities` data set deleted.

# nominatimlite 0.2.1

-   Remove **osmdata** from Suggests.
-   Fix examples.

# nominatimlite 0.2.0

-   **rlang** and **tibble** are not explicitly required. Conversions to tibble
    happens with `dplyr::tibble()`.
-   The data attributes of `sf` objects are returned now as `tibble`, for easy
    printing in console.
-   Improvements in code and tests.
-   Now `sf` objects can handle correctly nested fields provided in the json
    response (for example, the nested address field provided by the API). This
    is consistent also with the results provided by the non-spatial functions,
    were unnesting was already handled correctly.
-   Improvements on the output of `reverse_geo_lite()` and
    `reverse_geo_lite_sf()` when the API returns nested lists.

# nominatimlite 0.1.5

-   Centralize API queries on (internal) function `api_call()`.
-   Queries fully honors now the [Nominatim Usage
